# About Me
Hi, I'm a 19-year-old web developer from the Philippines taking Information Technology Entrepreneurship at Ateneo de Manila University.
So, I see you've stumbled upon my node package. *Hmmmm*, I don't really have time to say much right now but I'll try my best to document everything.

# What is this?

This is a package that combines a lot of the packages I use and houses lots of methods that just make life a little easier for me.

Some highlights about this package
- Most functions are executed synchronously.
- Easy use with JSON â€“ reading, writing, parsing & stringifying.
- Easy Pug compiling with PHP filter support.
- SASS rendering along with CSS autoprefixing.
- Easier handling of files and directories.
- CSS and HTML files are beautified by default since Pug and SASS doesn't really do a good job at that.
- Recursively compresses and resizes all images in a directory.


# Use
Run `npm install mike-node` in Terminal or what ever lel and put this in your JavaScript file.
```js   
var mike = require('mike-node');
```
# Methods
Olrayt lets get on with it.

### mike.mkdir(path)
This `mkdir` differs from `fs`'s or `fs-extra`'s as it creates all the directories that lead up to the last directory in the `path` argument. This means passing `"some/body/once"` to the function will create 3 folders that take the structure of the path if those directories dont exist.

### mike.write(file, content)
Self-explanatory; this writes a file with the 2nd argument as its content. This calls the `mkdir` function on the directory leading up to the file's directory to make sure the file gets written. The example below will auto-create the folders if they dont exist and will write the file as well with the right content.
```js
mike.write("some/body/once/told.me", "the world");
```

### mike.read(file)
Self-explanatory.
